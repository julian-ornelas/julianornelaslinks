# Links
Here are my links! I made this with the intention of being able to easily share my links, and to create a digital business card so I can better share my information with others using NFC technology by tapping.

I saw someone with a digital business card at an in-person networking event, they scanned their Popl card on my phone and I was in awe. I thought it was so cool, that I had to try to get one; however, I wanted something that was open source and decided to make my own using LittleLink, self-hosted on Vercel!

### LittleLink
I used <a href="https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LittleLink</a> to design this digital business card!

I highly reccomend using their repository if you're interested in making your own link repository to share with others!
