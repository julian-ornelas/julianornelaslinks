# Links
Here are my links! I made this with the intention of being able to easily share my links, and to create a digital business card so I can better share my information with others using NFC technology by tapping.

I saw someone with one at an in-person networking event, and thought it was so cool and I had to try it!

### LittleLink
I used <a href="https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LittleLink</a> to design this digital business card!

I highly reccomend using their repository if you're interested in making your own link repository to share with others!
